## Summarize & highlight podcast episodes for busy listeners

"build an LLM app that summarizes a podcast episode, identifies podcast guests, identifies key highlights, and more!"

1. use a Large Language Model (LLM) "gpt-3.5-turbo" from OpenAI to build the information extraction functionality paired with a Speech to Text model for transcribing the podcast

2. use a simple cloud deployment provider to easily convert the information extraction function to run on demand - this would be the app's backend

3. create and deploy a front-end that allows users to experience the end-to-end functionality
